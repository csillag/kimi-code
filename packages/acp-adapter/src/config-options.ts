/**
 * Build the unified `SessionConfigOption[]` surface (PLAN D11) advertised on
 * `session/new` + `session/load` and refreshed by `config_option_update`.
 *
 * Phase 14 unifies model + mode selection under the spec's generic
 * `configOptions` channel — replacing Phase 12's dedicated
 * `NewSessionResponse.modes` field — so a client like Zed renders both
 * pickers from a single source of truth and can flip either through
 * `session/set_config_option`.
 *
 * The v0 surface has up to three options:
 *   - `id: 'model'`     (`type: 'select'`, `category: 'model'`) — one row
 *     per {@link AcpModelEntry}, no `,thinking` variants. Thinking is
 *     an orthogonal axis exposed as a separate toggle.
 *   - `id: 'thinking'`  (`type: 'select'`, `category: 'thought_level'`)
 *     — appears ONLY when the currently-selected model's catalog row has
 *     `thinkingSupported === true`; otherwise omitted from the snapshot
 *     so the client doesn't render a non-actionable toggle. Phase 16
 *     converted this from `SessionConfigBoolean` to a 2-entry select
 *     (`off` / `on`) so Zed renders it — Zed's chip strip currently
 *     only knows how to draw `type: 'select'` options, and the spec's
 *     `boolean` arm shows up as "Unknown". Effort granularity
 *     (`'low' | 'medium' | …`) is still hidden behind the adapter —
 *     kimi-code uses a single non-`'off'` level under the hood (the
 *     model's default effort, resolved by agent-core's
 *     `resolveThinkingEffort`).
 *   - `id: 'mode'`      (`type: 'select'`, `category: 'mode'`) — the
 *     locked 4-mode taxonomy from PLAN D9 ({@link ACP_MODES}).
 *
 * The wire shape mirrors `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` `SessionConfigOption`
 * (`schema/types.gen.d.ts:4449-4480`): each option carries `id`, `name`,
 * optional `category`, and a `type`-discriminated `currentValue` (string
 * for `'select'`, boolean for `'boolean'`).

/**
 * Project the catalog into the `SessionConfigOption` `model` arm.
 *
 * One option row per catalog entry — Phase 15 removed the inlined
 * `${id},thinking` variant rows in favour of a separate
 * {@link buildThinkingOption} toggle (Phase 16 then changed that toggle
 * from `boolean` to a 2-entry `select` for Zed compatibility, but the
 * model picker shape is unaffected), so the model dropdown stays at most
 * N rows even when many catalog entries support thinking. The Python
 * reference's `_expand_llm_models` (`kimi-cli/src/kimi_cli/acp/server.py:441-468`)
 * still emits twin rows, but it has no `select`-based effort
 * equivalent; we diverge intentionally for UX clarity.
 *
 * `currentValue` is the bare model id (no `,thinking` suffix). When
 * an external caller still sends the merged form via
 * `unstable_setSessionModel({ modelId: 'k2,thinking' })`,
 * {@link AcpSession.setModel} splits the suffix off and updates both
 * the model and thinking authoritative state before the snapshot is
 * built — so the value reaching this builder is always already-split.

 * reserved bucket for reasoning / thinking knobs; using it lets a client
 * like Zed render the option with the right icon / placement without the
 * adapter advertising a custom category.
 *
 * Two shapes, chosen by whether the current model declares graded
 * reasoning levels (`support_efforts`):
 *
 *  - **Graded model** (`supportedEfforts` non-empty): advertise `off`
 *    plus each declared level (`low` / `medium` / `high` / …) so an ACP
 *    client can render a reasoning-effort slider and round-trip a chosen
 *    grade live over `session/set_config_option`, matching the REST / web
 *    surface. `always_thinking` models drop the `off` level (the runtime
 *    clamps `off` back to a real effort — see agent-core `resolveThinkingEffort`),
 *    so offering it would be a lie.
 *  - **Boolean model** (no `support_efforts`): the historical 2-entry
 *    `off` / `on` select — `on` maps to the model's default effort under
 *    the hood. Kept verbatim so pre-graded Zed clients are unaffected.
 *    `always_thinking` collapses this to a single locked `on` entry.
 *
 * Phase 16 introduced the 2-entry `select` form (over `type: 'boolean'`)
 * because Zed's chip strip only renders `select` options; the graded form
 * reuses the same `select` encoding, just with more entries.
 *
 * `currentEffort` is expected to already be one of the advertised values
 * (the caller normalizes via {@link buildSessionConfigOptions}); it is
 * echoed as `currentValue`. The caller also decides whether to include
 * this option at all — when the current model has
 * `thinkingSupported === false` the snapshot omits it entirely.

 * is reachable first. The thinking toggle is wedged between them so its
 * effect on the model selection above is visually adjacent.
 *
 * The thinking toggle only appears when the currently-selected base
 * model is `thinkingSupported`; otherwise the snapshot is just
 * `[modelOption, modeOption]`. This means switching from a thinking-
 * capable model (e.g. `kimi-coder`) to a non-thinking one (e.g.
 * `kimi-plain`) causes the next `config_option_update` to omit the
 * toggle entirely — Zed's UI is expected to handle "option set changes
 * across updates", which is the standard configOptions contract.
 *
 * Calls {@link listModelsFromHarness} exactly once per invocation so a
 * session refresh after each model/mode/thinking change is a single
 * round-trip to the harness. The helper itself is tolerant to
 * partial-stub harnesses: missing `getConfig` or a throwing one resolve
 * to an empty catalog, so the model picker ships an empty options
 * array and the thinking toggle is suppressed (no current model means
 * no thinkingSupported signal to read).
 *
 * Returns a mutable `SessionConfigOption[]` (rather than `readonly`) so
 * the value is assignable to the SDK's `NewSessionResponse.configOptions`
 * field, which is typed `Array<SessionConfigOption>` — TypeScript treats
 * `readonly T[]` as not assignable to `T[]` even when callers never
 * mutate it.
